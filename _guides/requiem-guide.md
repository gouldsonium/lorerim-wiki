# Requiem - A Roleplaying Overhaul for Skyrim
###### By BiggieBoss

Requiem is a project with the goal of turning Skyrim into a better roleplaying experience by making the game more immersive, semi-realistic, and coherent, with the intent to find a compromise between old school mechanics and more modern approaches. It's too much to describe here, so if you are truly into roleplaying games, feel free to check it out.

## Tips for Lorerim

- You can change damage dealt/received in the Requiem MCM menu. Don't feel bad about lowering it, especially if you're new to Requiem.
- You need to find crafting manuals to invest into smithing perks.
- Perk trees are essentially useless without a perk invested in them. You get 3 perks to start with.
- Standing stones are replaced with birthsigns. You can only switch birthsigns within your standing stone group (Warrior/Thief/Mage/Serpent).
- **Level 1-10**: Fight small creatures and lightly armored bandits.
- **Level 11-20**: Fight medium-sized creatures and any bandits.
- **Level 21-30**: Fight larger creatures and undead.
- **Level 31-40**: Fight forsworn and massive creatures.
- **Level 41-50**: Fight vampires and boss monsters.
- **Level 51+**: By this level, you should be able to fight anything.
- If playing with survival mode, make sure to be rested and well-fed.

## LoreRim Changes from Vanilla Requiem

- Resistance and Armor Rating caps to 75% reduction.
- Diseases and poisons are blockable.
- LoreRim incorporates Sacrilege as the vampire overhaul and Growl as the werewolf overhaul with their corresponding Requiem patches.
- Werewolves have been further nerfed. You are weak to poison and silver. Your power is on an 1800-second delay. Your starting timer is only 60 seconds with +15 seconds per feed. You can't just stay a werewolf forever.
- Wintersun is incorporated with Ixion's Wintersun nerfs as well as additional LoreRim nerfs. Prayer is a once per day power. You only start with 5 favor. LoreRim also uses the Wintersun Skillrate Alternative mod.
- Races are handled through NoxCrab's Tweaks (see the Articles page for Races Redone). I gave each race more starting carry weight and unarmed damage, though, as well as an additional skill boost to further diversify the starting choices.
- Magic and Weapon perks are mostly handled through NoxCrab's Tweaks and NoxCrab's "Magic Redone" mod. Many custom changes were made, especially to One and Two-handed trees to better synergize with MCO.
- Stealth perks are handled through NoxCrab's Tweaks "Stealth Redone" as well as my own Lockpicking & Pickpocket reworks.
