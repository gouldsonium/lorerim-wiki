# Frequently Asked Questions
Please checkout these FAQs before posting your question to the discord

### How much space?
- ~350GB install, ~250GB download, ~600GB total.
- **MAKE SURE TO SETUP A 40GB PAGE FILE**. [How to Manage Virtual Memory (Pagefile) in Windows 10](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/how-to-manage-virtual-memory-pagefile-windows-10,36929.html)

### Why is it giving me install errors?
- Make sure you download all Anniversary Edition (paid upgrade) content and launch Skyrim SE in Steam once to install.
- Also, make sure to download Skyrim SE Creation Kit and launch it at least once.

### How to change Resolution?
- The best way is through the `SSEDisplayTweaks.ini` file, which is located in the "LoreRim - MCM and INI Settings" mod.
- Note: This file is in the **MOD** in MO2, and **NOT IN-GAME**.

### System Requirements?
- Not sure, but probably at least:
  - 2070 for 1080p on default profile
  - 4080 for 4k on ultra profile

### I crash with Wheeler.
- Press `Home` and navigate to Wheeler and "reset wheels" if this happens.

### I crash on load after death?
- That's why the death alternative mod exists â€” to disincentivize reloading.
- If you have to reload, wait about 60 seconds outside of combat or traveling before attempting to.
- This is a script-heavy modlist. Reloading in combat or during events can cause issues.
- The **IDEAL** way to reload is to exit out of the game completely to the desktop and reload.

### I crash after loading a cell?
- Please check if it is repeatable. Lux can sometimes cause freak random crashes, but it's impossible to diagnose if it isn't repeatable.
- This just has to do with how the lighting, shadows, and meshes interact with each other.
- Still, Lux is by far the best currently available lighting mod, so it stays.

### I'm walking slow?
- You're out of stamina. Requiem feature.
- Make sure to manage your stamina. Invest perks in armor, otherwise, it will drain over time. Eat food. Grab the Lady Stone.

### My FPS is so bad?
- Enable the default profile.
- Run VRAMR; no official support if you run VRAMR though, do it at your own discretion. (From WhisperDealer)
- Also recommend Lossless Scaling.

### Widescreen/Controller support?
- Yes, look at the optional sections towards the bottom of MO2.

### My followers have no carry weight?
- They have similar restrictions to the player. No free pack mules.

### How do I make potions?
- You need empty bottles. You can find them, buy them, or get them back from using potions.

### How to change dual block or parry key?
- It's in the Dual Parry INI settings. [DXScanCodes](https://ck.uesp.net/wiki/Input_Script#DXScanCodes)

### How to prevent followers from dying?
- In Requiem MCM settings, turn off Requiem's essential/protected handling system.

### Where are the dragons?
- Go to Helgen and stay a night at the inn to start the main story. From here continue as you normally would
  to get dragons to start spawning, by going through the Bleak Falls Barrow quest, etc.

### I crash on my potato?
- At the end of the day, LoreRim has mid-spec requirements for the normal profile and high-end for Ultra.
- If you don't meet these, I can't do much for you unfortunately.
- You **ABSOLUTELY** must meet the minimum requirements and install the list on a **SOLID STATE DRIVE**.
