# Safe to Modify
**Rule 11:** "If you make any changes to the mod lists, note that we cannot offer you help for issues that arise from those changes." However, there are some features that are safe to modify through the MCM (Mod Configuration Menu).

## Safe Optional Mods

- At the bottom of Mod Organizer 2 there are some optional mods that can be enabled and disabled. These are in bright pink/purple/yellow categories.

### ReShade
- Make sure to disable frame generation when using this mod as they are mutually exclusive. This also comes with a performance hit.

### ENB Options
- Disable the existing ENB before re-enabling another one. I also recomemnd you go to the bottom of MO2, right click the "Overwrite" section and clear overwrite folder. This will clear the ENB cache.

### Optional Gameplay Mods
- **Smooth Random Sprint** has a more modern sprint animation. Can be disabled at anytime.
- **JellyFishFP Movement** causes first person camera bobbing when walking. Disable at anytime if you don't like it.
- **Dynamic State Scaler** should only be disabled on new saves. This causes high-level enemies to have stat scaling. Comes with a slight performance cost for some users.
- **Nazeemization** gives Nazeem a lore-accurate walking animation. Can be disabled at anytime.
- **HDT-SMP Creaiton Backpacks** can be disabled at anytime for an fps boost. They add physics effects to vanilla backpacks.
- **More Undying Undead** causes undead enemies to resurrect if not properly killed. Can be sometimes buggy. Once enabled, you should not disable it without a new save.
- **Improved Camera SE** causes you to be able to see your body in first person. Has some side-effects and bugs. Once enabled, you should not disable it without a new save.
- ** Go to Bed** provides animations for the player going to sleep. Can be buggy particularly with leveling or getting stuck in tents. Once enabled, you should not disable it without a new save.
- ** Campire Sun Immunity When Wearing Helmet or Hat** does as the name suggests and provides a condition that blocks the detriments of vampirisim in sunlight if you're wearing a hat. Can be enabled/disabled at anytime.
- **STB Widgets** adds new UI elements showing resistances, gold carried, time of day, etc. 32x9 users might want to disable it if they have UI issues.
- **ENB Frame Gen** tanks base performance but allows for "fake" frames to be dynamically generated, providing possibly a smoother experience. I would only suggest this if you already get at least 60 base FPS.
- **Arachnophobia Mod** adds new models for spiders and other arachnids. Safe to enable/disable at anytime.

## Safe MCM Modifications - This is not a comprehensive list. Other MCMs MAY be safe. Please just let us know in reports if you've modified any MCMs.

## Important Notes

Turning on/off certain MCM features can break things. Outside of this list, the MCM is set up in the intended manner, and touching anything else breaks **Rule 11**. If you think an MCM option you want to change isn't on this list, please let me know on Discord, and I will review it.
